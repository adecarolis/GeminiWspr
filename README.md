# GeminiWspr


Consider this to be Alpha Software. Current version is: v0.17a
 

Current compile stats are:

Sketch uses 24216 bytes or 78% (previously 69%) of program storage space. Maximum is 30720 bytes. 
Global variables use 1272 bytes or 62% (previously 51%) of dynamic memory, leaving 776 bytes for local variables. 
Maximum is 2048 bytes.

For this sketch to work properly you will need to calibrate the Si5351a Clock to determine the initial CORRECTION value
and hard-code that in the BoardConfig.h file. 

Notes on Software Versioning:

#define GEMINI_FW_VERSION "v0.08a" // in GeminiSerialMonitor.h update with each submission to github

Whole numbers are for released versions. (i.e. 1.0, 2.0 etc.)
Numbers to the right of the decimal are allocated consecutively, one per GITHUB submission.(i.e. 0.01, 0.02 etc)
a=alpha b=beta, r=release


Changelog : 
v017a - Phase two of Telemetry. This implements the VE3GTC KISS Telemetry scheme, encoding data into the WSPR message Pwr/dBm field.
It includes Gemini State Machine and scheduler changes to enable the transmission of a secondary WSPR message carrying telemetry at 
hh:02, hh:12, hh:22, hh:32, hh:42 and hh:52. 
v0.16a - Phase one of Telemetry. This update introduces some Telemetry Data structures and includes the encoding of the 5th and 6th 
Maidenhead Grid Square characters into the PWR/dBm field of the primary WSPR message using a scheme developed by VE3GTC. 

v0.15a - Minor code changes to improve WSPR TX timing. Modified the gemini_scheduler() function to generate the PRIMARY_WSPR_TX_TIME_EV
at (Second == 1) rather than (Second = 0) to reduce DT values. Addressed Issue #1 raised against Gemini in GITHUB, by
synchronizing the 1.46 second WSPR TX interrupt to the start of the WSPR transmission, by clearing TCNT1 and doing a Prescaler
reset to zero the count. 

v0.14a - Gemini Self calibration with Si5351a frequency correction using  a Huff-n-Puff Algorithm. Supports both External Interrupts
and PinChangeInterrupts for GPS PPS signal and requires unused clock output from Si5351a to be wired to ATMEGA328p PIN D5, which
is the external clock input for Timer1. Timer1 is used as a counter to sample a 3.2 Mhz calibration signal from the Si5351a.
The GPS PPS signal is used as a time-base to implement a simple frequency counter. A ten second sample is used to measure the
frequency, accurate to 1/10 Hz and then a correction factor is applied to the Si5351a and the output frequency regenerated. This 
is repeated 24 times, yielding a self-calibration cycle of approximately 4 minutes, prior to each transmission. The initial cycle
after powerup uses a 1 Hz correction factor and subsequent calibrations use 0.1Hz steps to achieve approximately 1 Hz accuracy
for the beacon at 14 Mhz. 

v0.13a - support K1FM v1.2 board and GPS and Si5351 power disable feature.

v0.12a - Introduced board configuration. Individual .h files are stored in board_configuration folder and are coped and renamed  
GeminiBoardConfig.h to provide #defines necessary to configure PINs and functionality include HW vs SW Serial (to GPS and debug 
monitor) as well as HW and SW I2C communication with the Si5351a. See GeminiBoardConfig.h for more info. 

v0.11a - replaced TinyGps library with NeoGps to resolve compatibility issues with uBlox NEO-M8N due to TinyGpses
lack of support for GNSSes other the GPS. 

v0.10a - added "QRM avoidance" feature which applies a random frequency offset in the range of 0 to 180 Hz to the 
base (bottom + 10 hz) transmit frequency for that transmit cycle. Also added the capability disable this feature via 
the Gemini Serial Monitor for testing purposes. Minor changes made to add some preliminary data structures to support
further telemetry data. 

v0.09a - added two additonal states WAIT_TELEMETRY_ST and TELEMETRY_ST and associated events and actions 
(see State Machine Diagram for details). Added support for the calculation of 6 character GRID
Square from GPS Lat/Long and transmission of the first 4 characters of that calculated Grid Square in the Primary 
WSPR message. 

v0.08a - files GeminiSerialMonitor.h and GeminiSerialMonitor.cpp 
to implement a primative serial shell and implement software error logging and state machine tracing capabilities.
Added software versioning. 
 
v0.07a - Added two additional files GeminiStateMachine.cpp and GeminiStateMachine.h that 
implement a finate state machine control mechanism for the Gemini WSPR Beacon. Added a folder called 
GeminiFSMDocs which contains a .graphml source file (yEd Graphical Editor) and a .jpg export which documents the current
implementation of the Gemini finite state machine. These are intended to be living documents and will be updated
each time that there are changes made to the state machine.
